It focuses on\\nthe small core commands that you will use the 80% or\\n90% of the time, trying to simp lify the usage of the\\nmore complex ones.\\nAll those commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL,\\nand anywhere you have a UNIX environment.\\nI hope the contents of this book will help you achieve\\nwhat you want: get comfortable with Linux .\\nThis book is written by Flavio. I publish\\nprogramming tutorials  every day on my website\\nflaviocopes.com .\\nYou can reach me on T witter @flaviocopes .\\nEnjoy!5Introduction to Linux and\\nshells\\nLinux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.\\nIt is also the most popular Open Source and free, as in\\nfreedom, operating system.\\nIt powers the vast majority of the servers that\\ncompose the Internet. It\\'s the base upon which\\neverything is built upon. But not just that. Android is\\nbased on (a modified version of) Linux.\\nThe Linux \"core\" (called kernel ) was born in 1991 in\\nFinland, and it went a really long way from its humble\\nbeginnings. It went on to be the kernel of the GNU\\nOperating System, creating the duo GNU/Linux.\\nThere\\'s one thing about Linux that corporations like\\nMicrosoft and Apple, or Google, will never be able to\\noffer: the freedom to do whatev er you want with your\\ncomputer .\\nThey\\'re actually  going in the opposite direction,\\nbuilding walled gardens, especially on the mobile side.\\nLinux is the ultimate freedom.\\nIt is develope d by volunteers, some paid by\\ncompanies that rely on it, some independently , but\\nthere\\'s no single commercial company that can dictate\\nwhat goes into Linux, or the project priorities.6Linux can also be used as your day to day computer . I\\nuse macOS because I really enjoy the applications,\\nthe design and I also used to be an iOS and Mac apps\\ndeveloper , but before using it I used Linux as my main\\ncomputer Operating System.\\nNo one can dictate which apps you can run, or \"call\\nhome\" with apps that track you, your position, and\\nmore.\\nLinux is also special because there\\'s not just \"one\\nLinux\", like it happens on Windows or macOS.\\nInstead, we have distributions .\\nA \"distro \" is made by a company or organization and\\npackages the Linux core with additional programs and\\ntooling.\\nFor example you have Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu,\\nprobably the most popular .\\nMany , many more exist. You can create your own\\ndistribution, too. But most likely you\\'ll use a popular\\none, one that has lots of users and a community of\\npeople around it, so you can do what you need to do\\nwithout losing too much time reinventing the wheel\\nand figuring out answers to common problems.\\nSome desktop computers and laptops ship with Linux\\npreinstalled. Or you can install it on your Windows-\\nbased computer , or on a Mac.\\nBut you don\\'t need to disrupt your existing computer\\njust to get an idea of how Linux works.\\nI don\\'t have a Linux computer .7If you use a Mac you need to know that under the\\nhood macOS is a UNIX Operating System, and it\\nshares a lot of the same ideas and software that a\\nGNU/Linux syste m uses, because GNU/Linux is a free\\nalternative to UNIX.\\nUNIX  is an umbrella term that groups many\\noperating systems used in big corporations and\\ninstitutions, starting from the 70\\'s\\nThe macOS terminal gives you access to the same\\nexact commands I\\'ll describe in the rest of this\\nhandbook.\\nMicrosoft has an official Windows Subsystem for Linux\\nwhich you can (and should!) install on Windows. This\\nwill give you the ability to run Linux in a very easy way\\non your PC.\\nBut the vast majority of the time you will run a Linux\\ncomputer in the cloud via a VPS (Virtual Private\\nServer) like DigitalOcean.\\nA shell is a command interpreter that exposes to the\\nuser an interface to work with the underlying operating\\nsystem.\\nIt allows you to execute operations using text and\\ncommands, and it provides users advanced features\\nlike being able to create scripts.\\nThis is importan t: shells let you perform things in a\\nmore optimized way than a GUI (Graphical User\\nInterface) could ever possibly let you do. Command\\nline tools can of fer many dif ferent configuration options\\nwithout being too complex to use.8There are many different kind of shells. This post\\nfocuses on Unix shells, the ones that you will find\\ncommonly on Linux and macOS computers.\\nMany different kind of shells were created for those\\nsystems over time, and a few of them dominate the\\nspace: Bash, Csh, Zsh, Fish and many more!\\nAll shells originate from the Bourne Shell, called \\xa0sh\\xa0.\\n\"Bourne\" because its creator was Steve Bourne.\\nBash means Bourne-again shell. \\xa0sh\\xa0 was proprietary\\nand not open source, and Bash was created in 1989\\nto create a free alternative for the GNU project and the\\nFree Software Foundation. Since projects had to pay\\nto use the Bourne shell, Bash became very popular .\\nIf you use a Mac, try opening your Mac terminal. That\\nby default is running ZSH. (or , pre-Catalina, Bash)\\nYou can set up your system to run any kind of shell,\\nfor example I use the Fish shell.\\nEach single shell has its own unique features and\\nadvanced usage, but they all share a common\\nfunctionality: they can let you execute programs, and\\nthey can be programmed.\\nIn the rest of this handbook we\\'ll see in detail the most\\ncommon commands you will use.9man\\nThe first command I want to introduce is a command\\nthat will help you understand all the other commands.\\nEvery time I don\\'t know how to use a command, I type\\n\\xa0man <command> \\xa0 to get the manual:\\nThis is a man (from manual ) page. Man pages are an\\nessential tool to learn, as a developer . They contain so\\nmuch information that sometimes it\\'s almost too much.\\nThe above screenshot is just 1 of 14 screens of\\nexplanation for the \\xa0ls\\xa0 command.\\nMost of the times when I\\'m in need to learn a\\ncommand quick ly I use this site called tldr pages :\\nhttps://tldr .sh/. It\\'s a comman d you can install, then\\nyou run it like this: \\xa0tldr <command> \\xa0, which gives you a\\nvery quick overview of a command, with some handy\\nexamples of common usage scenarios:10\\nThis is not a substitute for \\xa0man\\xa0, but a handy tool to\\navoid losing yourself in the huge amount of\\ninformation present in a man page. Then you can use\\nthe man page to explore all the different options and\\nparameters you can use on a command.11ls\\nInside a folder you can list all the files that the folder\\ncontains using the \\xa0ls\\xa0 command:\\nls \\nIf you add a folder name or path, it will print that folder\\ncontents:\\nls /bin \\n\\xa0ls\\xa0 accepts a lot of options. One of my favorite\\noptions combinations is \\xa0-al\\xa0. Try it:\\nls -al /bin  12\\ncompared to the plain \\xa0ls\\xa0, this returns much more\\ninformation.\\nYou have, from left to right:\\nthe file permissions (and if your system supports\\nACLs, you get an ACL flag as well)\\nthe number of links to that file\\nthe owner of the file\\nthe group of the file\\nthe file size in bytes\\nthe file modified datetime\\nthe file name\\nThis set of data is generated by the \\xa0l\\xa0 option. The \\xa0a\\xa0\\noption instead also shows the hidden files.\\nHidden files are files that start with a dot ( \\xa0.\\xa0).13cd\\nOnce you have a folder , you can move into it using the\\n\\xa0cd\\xa0 command. \\xa0cd\\xa0 means change directory . You\\ninvoke it specifying a folder to move into. You can\\nspecify a folder name, or an entire path.\\nExample:\\nmkdir fruits  \\ncd fruits \\nNow you are into the \\xa0fruits\\xa0 folder .\\nYou can use the \\xa0..\\xa0 special path to indicate the\\nparent folder:\\ncd .. #back to the home folder\\nThe # character indicates the start of the comment,\\nwhich lasts for the entire line after it\\'s found.\\nYou can use it to form a path:\\nmkdir fruits  \\nmkdir cars  \\ncd fruits \\ncd ../cars  \\nThere is another special path indicator which is \\xa0.\\xa0,\\nand indicates the current  folder .\\nYou can also use absolute paths, which start from the\\nroot folder \\xa0/\\xa0:14cd /etc \\nThis command works on Linux, macOS, WSL,\\nand anywhere you have a UNIX environment15pwd\\nWhenever you feel lost in the filesystem, call the \\xa0pwd\\xa0\\ncommand to know where you are:\\npwd\\nIt will print the current folder path.16mkdir\\nYou create folders using the \\xa0mkdir\\xa0 command:\\nmkdir fruits  \\nYou can create multiple folders with one command:\\nmkdir dogs cars  \\nYou can also create multiple nested folders by adding\\nthe \\xa0-p\\xa0 option:\\nmkdir -p fruits/apples  \\nOptions in UNIX commands commonly take this form.\\nYou add them right after the command name, and they\\nchange how the command behaves. You can often\\ncombine multiple options, too.\\nYou can find which options a command supports by\\ntyping \\xa0man <commandname> \\xa0. Try now with \\xa0man mkdir\\xa0\\nfor example (press the \\xa0q\\xa0 key to esc the man page).\\nMan pages are the amazing built-in help for UNIX.17rmdir\\nJust as you can create a folder using \\xa0mkdir\\xa0, you can\\ndelete a folder using \\xa0rmdir\\xa0:\\nmkdir fruits  \\nrmdir fruits  \\nYou can also delete multiple folders at once:\\nmkdir fruits cars  \\nrmdir fruits cars  \\nThe folder you delete must be empty .\\nTo delete folders with files in them, we\\'ll use the more\\ngeneric \\xa0rm\\xa0 command which deletes files and folders,\\nusing the \\xa0-rf\\xa0 options:\\nrm -rf fruits cars  \\nBe careful as this command does not ask for\\nconfirmation and it will immedia tely remove anything\\nyou ask it to remove.\\nThere is no bin when removin g files from the\\ncommand line, and recovering lost files can be hard.18mv\\nOnce you have a file, you can move it around using\\nthe \\xa0mv\\xa0 command. You specify the file current path,\\nand its new path:\\ntouch test \\nmv pear new_pear  \\nThe \\xa0pear\\xa0 file is now move d to \\xa0new_pear \\xa0. This is how\\nyou rename  files and folders.\\nIf the last parameter is a folder , the file located at the\\nfirst parameter path is going to be moved into that\\nfolder . In this case, you can specify a list of files and\\nthey will all be moved in the folder path identified by\\nthe last parameter:\\ntouch pear  \\ntouch apple  \\nmkdir fruits  \\nmv pear apple fruits #pear and apple moved to the fr\\n19cp\\nYou can copy a file using the \\xa0cp\\xa0 command:\\ntouch test \\ncp apple another_apple  \\nTo copy folders you need to add the \\xa0-r\\xa0 option to\\nrecursively copy the whole folder contents:\\nmkdir fruits  \\ncp -r fruits cars  20open\\nThe \\xa0open\\xa0 command lets you open a file using this\\nsyntax:\\nopen <filename>  \\nYou can also open a directory , which on macOS opens\\nthe Finder app with the current directory open:\\nopen <directory name>  \\nI use it all the time to open the current directory:\\nopen . \\nThe special \\xa0.\\xa0 symbo l points to the current\\ndirectory , as \\xa0..\\xa0 points to the parent directory\\nThe same command can also be be used to run an\\napplication:\\nopen <application name>  21touch\\nYou can create an empty file using the \\xa0touch\\xa0\\ncommand:\\ntouch apple  \\nIf the file already exists, it opens  the file in write mode,\\nand the timestamp of the file is updated.22find\\nThe \\xa0find\\xa0 command can be used to find files or\\nfolders matching a particular search pattern. It\\nsearches recursively .\\nLet\\'s learn it by example.\\nFind all the files under the curre nt tree that have the\\n\\xa0.js\\xa0 extension and print the relative path of each file\\nmatching:\\nfind . -name \\'*.js\\'\\nIt\\'s important to use quotes around special characters\\nlike \\xa0*\\xa0 to avoid the shell interpreting them.\\nFind directories under the curre nt tree matching the\\nname \"src\":\\nfind . -type d -name src  \\nUse \\xa0-type f\\xa0 to search only files, or \\xa0-type l\\xa0 to only\\nsearch symbolic links.\\n\\xa0-name\\xa0 is case sensitive. use \\xa0-iname\\xa0 to perform a\\ncase-insensitive search.\\nYou can search under multiple root trees:\\nfind folder1 folder2 -name filename.txt  23Find directories under the curre nt tree matching the\\nname \"node_modules\" or \\'public\\':\\nYou can also exclude a path, using \\xa0-not -path \\xa0:\\nYou can search files that have more than 100\\ncharacters (bytes) in them:\\nfind . -type f -size +100c  \\nSearch files bigger than 100KB but smaller than 1MB:\\nfind . -type f -size +100k -size -1M  \\nSearch files edited more than 3 days ago\\nfind . -type f -mtime +3  \\nSearch files edited in the last 24 hours\\nfind . -type f -mtime -1  \\nYou can delete all the files matching a search by\\nadding the \\xa0-delete\\xa0 option. This deletes all the files\\nedited in the last 24 hours:\\nfind . -type f -mtime -1 -delete  find . -type d -name node_modules -or -name public  \\nfind . -type d -name \\'*.md\\' -not -path \\'node_modules\\n24You can execute a command on each result of the\\nsearch. In this example we run \\xa0cat\\xa0 to print the file\\ncontent:\\nfind . -type f -exec cat {} \\\\;  \\nnotice the termin ating \\xa0\\\\;\\xa0. \\xa0{}\\xa0 is filled with the file\\nname at execution time.25ln\\nThe \\xa0ln\\xa0 command is part of the Linux file system\\ncommands.\\nIt\\'s used  to create links. What  is a link? It\\'s like a\\npointer to another file. A file that points to another file.\\nYou might be familiar with Windows shortcuts. They\\'re\\nsimilar .\\nWe have 2 types of links: hard links  and soft links .\\nH a rd  l i n k s\\nHard links are rarely used. They have a few\\nlimitations: you can\\'t link to directories, and you can\\'t\\nlink to external filesystems (disks).\\nA hard link is created using\\nln <original> <link>  \\nFor example, say you have a file called recipes.txt.\\nYou can create a hard link to it using:\\nln recipes.txt newrecipes.txt  \\nThe new hard link you create d is indistinguishable\\nfrom a regular file:26\\nNow any time you edit any of those files, the content\\nwill be updated for both.\\nIf you delete the original file, the link will still contain\\nthe original file content, as that\\'s not removed until\\nthere is one hard link pointing to it.\\nSo f t  l i n k s\\nSoft links are different. They are more powerful as you\\ncan link to other filesystems and to directories, but\\nwhen the original is removed, the link will be broken.\\nYou create soft links using the \\xa0-s\\xa0 option of \\xa0ln\\xa0:27ln -s <original> <link>  \\nFor example, say you have a file called recipes.txt.\\nYou can create a soft link to it using:\\nln -s recipes.txt newrecipes.txt  \\nIn this case you can see there\\'s a special \\xa0l\\xa0 flag\\nwhen you list the file using \\xa0ls -al\\xa0, and the file name\\nhas a \\xa0@\\xa0 at the end, and it\\'s colored differently if you\\nhave colors enabled:\\nNow if you delete the original file, the links will be\\nbroken, and the shell will tell you \"No such file or\\ndirectory\" if you try to access it:\\n28gzip\\nYou can compress a file using the gzip compression\\nprotocol named LZ77  using the \\xa0gzip\\xa0 command.\\nHere\\'s the simplest usage:\\ngzip filename  \\nThis will compress the file, and append a \\xa0.gz\\xa0\\nextension to it. The original file is deleted. To prevent\\nthis, you can use the \\xa0-c\\xa0 option and use output\\nredirection to write the output to the \\xa0filename.gz \\xa0 file:\\ngzip -c filename > filename.gz  \\nThe \\xa0-c\\xa0 option specifies that output will go to the\\nstandard output  stream, leaving the original file\\nintact\\nOr you can use the \\xa0-k\\xa0 option:\\ngzip -k filename  \\nThere are various levels of compression. The more\\nthe compression, the longer it will take to compress\\n(and decompress). Levels range  from 1 (fastest, worst\\ncompression) to 9 (slowest, better compression), and\\nthe default is 6.\\nYou can choose a specific level with the \\xa0-<NUMBER> \\xa0\\noption:29gzip -1 filename  \\nYou can compress multiple files by listing them:\\ngzip filename1 filename2  \\nYou can compress all the files in a directory ,\\nrecursively , using the \\xa0-r\\xa0 option:\\ngzip -r a_folder  \\nThe \\xa0-v\\xa0 option prints the compression  percentage\\ninformation. Here\\'s an example of it being used along\\nwith the \\xa0-k\\xa0 (keep) option:\\n\\xa0gzip\\xa0 can also be used to decompress a file, using\\nthe \\xa0-d\\xa0 option:\\ngzip -d filename.gz  30gunzip\\nThe \\xa0gunzip\\xa0 comma nd is basically equivale nt to the\\n\\xa0gzip\\xa0 command, except the \\xa0-d\\xa0 option is always\\nenabled by default.\\nThe command can be invoked in this way:\\ngunzip filename.gz  \\nThis will gunzip and will remove  the \\xa0.gz\\xa0 extension,\\nputting the result in the \\xa0filename \\xa0 file. If that file exists,\\nit will overwrite that.\\nYou can extract to a different filename using output\\nredirection using the \\xa0-c\\xa0 option:\\ngunzip -c filename.gz > anotherfilename  31tar\\nThe \\xa0tar\\xa0 comma nd is used to create an archive,\\ngrouping multiple files in a single file.\\nIts name comes from the past and means tape\\narchive . Back when archives were stored on tapes.\\nThis command creates an archive named\\n\\xa0archive.tar \\xa0 with the content of \\xa0file1\\xa0 and \\xa0file2\\xa0:\\ntar -cf archive.tar file1 file2  \\nThe \\xa0c\\xa0 option stands for create . The \\xa0f\\xa0 option is\\nused to write to file the archive.\\nTo extract files from an archive in the current folder ,\\nuse:\\ntar -xf archive.tar  \\nthe \\xa0x\\xa0 option stands for extract\\nand to extract them to a specific directory , use:\\ntar -xf archive.tar -C directory  \\nYou can also just list the files contained in an archive:32\\n\\xa0tar\\xa0 is often  used to create a compressed archive ,\\ngzipping the archive.\\nThis is done using the \\xa0z\\xa0 option:\\ntar -czf archive.tar.gz file1 file2  \\nThis is just like creating a tar archive, and then running\\n\\xa0gzip\\xa0 on it.\\nTo unarchive a gzipped archive, you can use \\xa0gunzip\\xa0,\\nor \\xa0gzip -d\\xa0, and then unarchive it, but \\xa0tar -xf\\xa0 will\\nrecognize it\\'s a gzipped archive, and do it for you:\\ntar -xf archive.tar.gz  33alias\\nIt\\'s common to always run a program with a set of\\noptions you like using.\\nFor example, take the \\xa0ls\\xa0 command. By default it\\nprints very little information:\\nwhile using the \\xa0-al\\xa0 option it will print something\\nmore useful, including the file modification date, the\\nsize, the owner , and the permissions, also listing\\nhidden files (files starting with a \\xa0.\\xa0:\\nYou can create a new command , for example I like to\\ncall it \\xa0ll\\xa0, that is an alias to \\xa0ls -al\\xa0.\\nYou do it in this way:34alias ll=\\'ls -al\\'\\nOnce you do, you can call \\xa0ll\\xa0 just like it was a\\nregular UNIX command:\\nNow calling \\xa0alias\\xa0 without any option will list the\\naliases defined:\\nThe alias will work until the terminal session is closed.\\nTo make it permanent, you need  to add it to the shell\\nconfiguration, which could be \\xa0~/.bashrc \\xa0 or\\n\\xa0~/.profile \\xa0 or \\xa0~/.bash_profile \\xa0 if you use the Bash\\nshell, depending on the use case.\\nBe careful with quotes if you have variables in the\\ncommand: using double quotes the variable is\\nresolved at definition time, using single quotes it\\'s\\nresolved at invocation time. Those 2 are dif ferent:35alias lsthis= \"ls $PWD\"\\nalias lscurrent= \\'ls $PWD\\'\\n$PWD refers to the current folder the shell is into. If\\nyou now navigate away to a new folder , \\xa0lscurrent \\xa0\\nlists the files in the new folder , \\xa0lsthis\\xa0 still lists the\\nfiles in the folder you were when you defined the alias.36cat\\nSimilar to \\xa0tail\\xa0 in some way, we have \\xa0cat\\xa0. Except\\n\\xa0cat\\xa0 can also add content to a file, and this makes it\\nsuper powerful.\\nIn its simplest usage, \\xa0cat\\xa0 prints a file\\'s content to the\\nstandard output:\\ncat file  \\nYou can print the content of multiple files:\\ncat file1 file2  \\nand using the output redirection operator \\xa0>\\xa0 you can\\nconcatenate the content of multiple files into a new\\nfile:\\ncat file1 file2 > file3  \\nUsing \\xa0>>\\xa0 you can append the content of multiple files\\ninto a new file, creating it if it does not exist:\\ncat file1 file2 >> file3  \\nWhen watching source code files it\\'s great to see the\\nline numbers, and you can have \\xa0cat\\xa0 print them using\\nthe \\xa0-n\\xa0 option:\\ncat -n file1  37You can only add a number to non-blank lines using \\xa0-\\nb\\xa0, or you can also remove all the multiple empty lines\\nusing \\xa0-s\\xa0.\\n\\xa0cat\\xa0 is often used in combination with the pipe\\noperator \\xa0|\\xa0 to feed a file content as input to another\\ncommand: \\xa0cat file1 | anothercommand \\xa0.38less\\nThe \\xa0less\\xa0 command is one I use a lot. It shows you\\nthe content stored inside a file, in a nice and\\ninteractive UI.\\nUsage: \\xa0less <filename> \\xa0.\\nOnce you are inside a \\xa0less\\xa0 session, you can quit by\\npressing \\xa0q\\xa0.\\nYou can navigate the file contents using the \\xa0up\\xa0 and\\n\\xa0down\\xa0 keys, or using  the \\xa0space bar\\xa0 and \\xa0b\\xa0 to\\nnavigate page by page. You can also jump to the end\\nof the file pressing \\xa0G\\xa0 and jump back  to the start\\npressing \\xa0g\\xa0.\\nYou can search contents inside the file by pressing \\xa0/\\xa0\\nand typing a word to search. This searches forward .\\nYou can search backwards using the \\xa0?\\xa0 symbol and\\ntyping a word.39This command just visualises the file\\'s content. You\\ncan directly open an editor by pressing \\xa0v\\xa0. It will use\\nthe system editor , which in most cases is \\xa0vim\\xa0.\\nPressing the \\xa0F\\xa0 key enters follow mode , or watch\\nmode . When the file is changed by someone else, like\\nfrom another program, you get to see the changes\\nlive. By default this is not happening , and you only see\\nthe file version at the time you opened it. You need to\\npress \\xa0ctrl-C\\xa0 to quit this mode. In this case the\\nbehaviour is similar to running the \\xa0tail -f\\n<filename> \\xa0 command.\\nYou can open multiple files, and navigate through\\nthem using \\xa0:n\\xa0 (to go to the next file) and \\xa0:p\\xa0 (to go\\nto the previous).40tail\\nThe best use case of tail in my opinion is when called\\nwith the \\xa0-f\\xa0 option. It opens the file at the end, and\\nwatches for file changes. Any time there is new\\ncontent in the file, it is printed in the window . This is\\ngreat for watching log files, for example:\\ntail -f /var/log/system.log  \\nTo exit, press \\xa0ctrl-C\\xa0.\\nYou can print the last 10 lines in a file:\\ntail -n 10 <filename>  \\nYou can print the whole file content starting from a\\nspecific line using \\xa0+\\xa0 before the line number:\\ntail -n +10 <filename>  \\n\\xa0tail\\xa0 can do much more and as always my advice is\\nto check \\xa0man tail \\xa0.41wc\\nThe \\xa0wc\\xa0 command gives us useful information about\\na file or input it receives via pipes.\\necho test >> test.txt  \\nwc test.txt  \\n1       1       5 test.txt  \\nExample via pipes, we can count the output of running\\nthe \\xa0ls -al\\xa0 command:\\nls -al | wc  \\n6      47     284  \\nThe first column returned is the number of lines. The\\nsecond is the number of words. The third is the\\nnumber of bytes.\\nWe can tell it to just count the lines:\\nwc -l test.txt  \\nor just the words:\\nwc -w test.txt  \\nor just the bytes:\\nwc -c test.txt  42Bytes in ASCII charsets equate to characters, but with\\nnon-ASCII chars ets, the number of characters might\\ndiffer because some characters might take multiple\\nbytes, for example this happens in Unicode.\\nIn this case the \\xa0-m\\xa0 flag will help getting the correct\\nvalue:\\nwc -m test.txt  43grep\\nThe \\xa0grep\\xa0 command is a very useful tool, that when\\nyou master will help you tremendously in your day to\\nday.\\nIf you\\'re wondering, \\xa0grep\\xa0 stands for global\\nregular expression print\\nYou can use \\xa0grep\\xa0 to search in files, or combine it\\nwith pipes to filter the output of another command.\\nFor exam ple here\\'s how we can find the occurences of\\nthe \\xa0document.getElementById \\xa0 line in the \\xa0index.md \\xa0 file:\\ngrep document.getElementById index.md  \\nUsing the \\xa0-n\\xa0 option it will show the line numbers:\\ngrep -n document.getElementById index.md  \\n44One very useful thing is to tell grep to print 2 lines\\nbefore, and 2 lines after the matched line, to give us\\nmore context. That\\'s done using the \\xa0-C\\xa0 option, which\\naccepts a number of lines:\\ngrep -nC 2 document.getElementById index.md  \\nSearch is case sensitive by default. Use the \\xa0-i\\xa0 flag\\nto make it insensitive.\\nAs ment ioned, you can use grep to filter the output of\\nanother command. We can replicate the same\\nfunctionality as above using:\\nless index.md | grep -n document.getElementById  \\nThe search string can be a regular expression, and\\nthis makes \\xa0grep\\xa0 very powerful.45Another thing you might find very useful is to invert the\\nresult, excluding the lines that match a particular\\nstring, using the \\xa0-v\\xa0 option:\\n46sort\\nSuppose you have a text file which contains the\\nnames of dogs:\\nThis list is unordered.\\nThe \\xa0sort\\xa0 command helps us sorting them by name:\\nUse the \\xa0r\\xa0 option to reverse the order:47\\nSorting by default is case sensitive, and alphabetic.\\nUse the \\xa0--ignore-case \\xa0 option to sort case insensitive,\\nand the \\xa0-n\\xa0 option to sort using a numeric order .\\nIf the file contains duplicate lines:\\nYou can use the \\xa0-u\\xa0 option to remove them:48\\n\\xa0sort\\xa0 does not just works on files, as many UNIX\\ncommands it also works with pipes, so you can use on\\nthe output of another command, for example you can\\norder the files returned by \\xa0ls\\xa0 with:\\nls | sort  \\n\\xa0sort\\xa0 is very powerful and has lots more options,\\nwhich you can explore calling \\xa0man sort \\xa0.49\\n50uniq\\n\\xa0uniq\\xa0 is a command useful to sort lines of text.\\nYou can get those lines from a file, or using pipes from\\nthe output of another command:\\nuniq dogs.txt  \\n \\nls | uniq  \\nYou need to consider this key thing: \\xa0uniq\\xa0 will only\\ndetect adjacent duplicate lines.\\nThis implies that you will most likely use it along with\\n\\xa0sort\\xa0:\\nsort dogs.txt | uniq  \\nThe \\xa0sort\\xa0 comma nd has its own way to remove\\nduplicates with the \\xa0-u\\xa0 ( unique ) option.

Suppose you have 2\\nfiles, which contain almost the same information, but\\nyou can\\'t find the dif ference between the two.\\n\\xa0diff\\xa0 will process the files and will tell you what\\'s the\\ndifference.\\nSuppose you have 2 files: \\xa0dogs.txt \\xa0 and\\n\\xa0moredogs.txt \\xa0. The difference is that \\xa0moredogs.txt \\xa0\\ncontains one more dog name:\\n\\xa0diff dogs.txt moredogs.txt \\xa0 will tell you the second\\nfile has one more line, line 3 with the line \\xa0Vanille\\xa0:\\n55If you invert the order of the files, it will tell you that the\\nsecond file is missing line 3, whose content is\\n\\xa0Vanille\\xa0:\\nUsing the \\xa0-y\\xa0 option will compare the 2 files line by\\nline:\\nThe \\xa0-u\\xa0 option however will be more familiar to you,\\nbecause that\\'s the same used by the Git version\\ncontrol system  to display differences between\\nversions:\\nComparing direc tories works in the same way.

It can\\ndecide the fate of that file.\\nThe owner (and the \\xa0root\\xa0 user) can change the\\nowner to another user, too, using the \\xa0chown\\xa0\\ncommand:\\nchown <owner> <file>  \\nLike this:\\nchown flavio test.txt  \\nFor example if you have a file that\\'s owned by \\xa0root\\xa0,\\nyou can\\'t write to it as another user:\\nYou can use \\xa0chown\\xa0 to transfer the ownership to you:62\\nIt\\'s rather common to have the need to change the\\nownership of a directory , and recursively all the files\\ncontained, plus all the subdirectories and the files\\ncontained in them, too.\\nYou can do so using the \\xa0-R\\xa0 flag:\\nchown -R <owner> <file>  \\nFiles/directories don\\'t just have an owner , they also\\nhave a group . Through this command you can\\nchange that simultaneously while you change the\\nowner:\\nchown <owner>:<group> <file>  \\nExample:\\nchown flavio:users test.txt  \\nYou can also just change the group of a file using the\\n\\xa0chgrp\\xa0 command:\\nchgrp <group> <filename>  63chmod\\nEvery file in the Linux / macOS Operating Systems\\n(and UNIX systems in general) has 3 permissions:\\nRead, write, execute.\\nGo into a folder , and run the \\xa0ls -al\\xa0 command.\\nThe weird strings you see on each file line, like \\xa0drwxr-\\nxr-x\\xa0, define the permissions of the file or folder .\\nLet\\'s dissect it.\\nThe first letter indicates the type of file:\\n\\xa0-\\xa0 means it\\'s a normal file\\n\\xa0d\\xa0 means it\\'s a directory\\n\\xa0l\\xa0 means it\\'s a link\\nThen you have 3 sets of values:\\nThe first set represents the permissions of the\\nowner  of the file\\nThe second set represents the permissions of the\\nmembers of the group  the file is associated to64The third set represents the permissions of the\\neveryone else\\nThose sets are composed by 3 values. \\xa0rwx\\xa0 means\\nthat specific persona  has read, write  and execution\\naccess. Anything that is removed is swapped with a\\n\\xa0-\\xa0, which lets you form various combinations of\\nvalues and relative permissions: \\xa0rw-\\xa0, \\xa0r--\\xa0, \\xa0r-x\\xa0,\\nand so on.\\nYou can change the permissions given to a file using\\nthe \\xa0chmod\\xa0 command.\\n\\xa0chmod\\xa0 can be used in 2 ways. The first is using\\nsymbolic arguments, the second is using numeric\\narguments. Let\\'s start with symbols first, which is more\\nintuitive.\\nYou type \\xa0chmod\\xa0 followed by a space, and a letter:\\n\\xa0a\\xa0 stands for all\\n\\xa0u\\xa0 stands for user\\n\\xa0g\\xa0 stands for group\\n\\xa0o\\xa0 stands for others\\nThen you type either \\xa0+\\xa0 or \\xa0-\\xa0 to add a permission, or\\nto remove it. Then you enter one or more permissions\\nsymbols ( \\xa0r\\xa0, \\xa0w\\xa0, \\xa0x\\xa0).\\nAll followed by the file or folder name.\\nHere are some examples:\\nchmod a+r filename #everyone can now read  \\nchmod a+rw filename #everyone can now read and write\\nchmod o-rwx filename #others (not the owner, not in \\n65You can apply the same permissions to multiple\\npersonas by adding multiple letters before the \\xa0+\\xa0/\\xa0-\\xa0:\\nIn case you are editing a folder , you can apply the\\npermissions to every file contained in that folder using\\nthe \\xa0-r\\xa0 (recursive) flag.\\nNumeric arguments are faster but I find them hard to\\nremember when  you are not using them day to day.\\nYou use a digit that represents the permissions of the\\npersona. This number value can be a maximum of 7,\\nand it\\'s calculated in this way:\\n\\xa01\\xa0 if has execution permission\\n\\xa02\\xa0 if has write permission\\n\\xa04\\xa0 if has read permission\\nThis gives us 4 combinations:\\n\\xa00\\xa0 no permissions\\n\\xa01\\xa0 can execute\\n\\xa02\\xa0 can write\\n\\xa03\\xa0 can write, execute\\n\\xa04\\xa0 can read\\n\\xa05\\xa0 can read, execute\\n\\xa06\\xa0 can read, write\\n\\xa07\\xa0 can read, write and execute\\nWe use them in pairs of 3, to set the permissions of all\\nthe 3 groups altogether:chmod og-r filename #other and group can\\'t read any \\n66chmod 777 filename  \\nchmod 755 filename  \\nchmod 644 filename  67umask\\nWhen you create a file, you don\\'t have to decide\\npermissions up front. Permissions have defaults.\\nThose defaults can be controlle d and modified using\\nthe \\xa0umask\\xa0 command.\\nTyping \\xa0umask\\xa0 with no arguments will show you the\\ncurrent umask, in this case \\xa00022\\xa0:\\nWhat does \\xa00022\\xa0 mean? That\\'s an octal value that\\nrepresent the permissions.\\nAnother common value is \\xa00002\\xa0.\\nUse \\xa0umask -S \\xa0 to see a human-readable notation:\\nIn this case, the user (\\xa0u\\xa0), owner of the file, has read,\\nwrite and execution permissions on files.68Other users belonging to the same group (\\xa0g\\xa0) have\\nread and execution permission, same as all the other\\nusers (\\xa0o\\xa0).\\nIn the numeric notation, we typically change the last 3\\ndigits.\\nHere\\'s a list that gives a meaning to the number:\\n\\xa00\\xa0 read, write, execute\\n\\xa01\\xa0 read and write\\n\\xa02\\xa0 read and execute\\n\\xa03\\xa0 read only\\n\\xa04\\xa0 write and execute\\n\\xa05\\xa0 write only\\n\\xa06\\xa0 execute only\\n\\xa07\\xa0 no permissions\\nNote that this numeric notation differs from the one we\\nuse in \\xa0chmod\\xa0.\\nWe can set a new value for the mask setting the value\\nin numeric format:\\numask 002 \\nor you can change a specific role\\'s permission:\\numask g+r 69du\\nThe \\xa0du\\xa0 command will calculate the size of a directory\\nas a whole:\\ndu \\nThe \\xa032\\xa0 number here is a value expressed in bytes.\\nRunning \\xa0du *\\xa0 will calculate the size of each file\\nindividually:\\nYou can set \\xa0du\\xa0 to displa y value s in MegaBytes using\\n\\xa0du -m\\xa0, and GigaBytes using \\xa0du -g\\xa0.70The \\xa0-h\\xa0 option will show a human-readable notation\\nfor sizes, adapting to the size:\\nAdding the \\xa0-a\\xa0 option will print the size of each file in\\nthe directories, too:\\nA handy thing is to sort the directories by size:\\ndu -h <directory> | sort -nr  \\nand then piping to \\xa0head\\xa0 to only get the first 10\\nresults:71\\n72df\\nThe \\xa0df\\xa0 comma nd is used to get disk usage\\ninformation.\\nIts basic form will print information about the volumes\\nmounted:\\nUsing the \\xa0-h\\xa0 option (\\xa0df -h\\xa0) will show those values\\nin a human-readable format:\\nYou can also specify a file or directory name to get\\ninformation about the specific volume it lives on:\\n73basename\\nSuppose you have a path to a file, for example\\n\\xa0/Users/flavio/test.txt \\xa0.\\nRunning\\nbasename /Users/flavio/test.txt  \\nwill return the \\xa0test.txt \\xa0 string:\\nIf you run \\xa0basename \\xa0 on a path string that points to a\\ndirectory , you will get the last segment of the path.

To list all processes we need to pass some\\noptions to \\xa0ps\\xa0.\\nThe most common I use is \\xa0ps ax\\xa0:76\\nThe \\xa0a\\xa0 option is used to also list other users\\nprocesses, not just our own. \\xa0x\\xa0 shows processes\\nnot linked to any terminal (not initiated by users\\nthrough a terminal).\\nAs you can see, the longer commands are cut. Use\\nthe command \\xa0ps axww\\xa0 to continue the command\\nlisting on a new line instead of cutting it:\\nWe need to specify \\xa0w\\xa0 2 times to apply this\\nsetting, it\\'s not a typo.77You can search for a specific process combining\\n\\xa0grep\\xa0 with a pipe, like this:\\nps axww | grep \"Visual Studio Code\"\\nThe columns returned by \\xa0ps\\xa0 represent some key\\ninformation.\\nThe first information is \\xa0PID\\xa0, the process ID. This is\\nkey when you want to reference this process in\\nanother command, for example to kill it.\\nThen we have \\xa0TT\\xa0 that tells us the terminal id used.\\nThen \\xa0STAT\\xa0 tells us the state of the process:\\n\\xa0I\\xa0 a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than\\nabout 20 seconds) \\xa0R\\xa0 a runnable process \\xa0S\\xa0 a\\nprocess that is sleeping for less than about 20\\nseconds \\xa0T\\xa0 a stopped process \\xa0U\\xa0 a process in\\nuninterruptible wait \\xa0Z\\xa0 a dead process (a zombie )\\nIf you have more than one letter , the second\\nrepresents further information, which can be very\\ntechnical.78It\\'s common to have \\xa0+\\xa0 which indicates the process is\\nin the foreground in its terminal. \\xa0s\\xa0 means the\\nprocess is a session leader .\\n\\xa0TIME\\xa0 tells us how long the process has been running.79top\\nA quick guide to the \\xa0top\\xa0 command, used to list the\\nprocesses running in real time\\nThe \\xa0top\\xa0 command is used to display dynamic real-\\ntime information about runnin g processes in the\\nsystem.\\nIt\\'s really handy to understand what is going on.\\nIts usage is simple, you just type \\xa0top\\xa0, and the\\nterminal will be fully immersed in this new view:\\nThe process is long-running. To quit, you can type the\\n\\xa0q\\xa0 letter or \\xa0ctrl-C\\xa0.\\nThere\\'s a lot of information being given to us: the\\nnumber of processes, how many are running or\\nsleeping, the system load, the CPU usage, and a lot\\nmore.80Below , the list of processes taking the most memory\\nand CPU is constantly updated.\\nBy default, as you can see from the \\xa0%CPU\\xa0 column\\nhighlighted, they are sorted by the CPU used.\\nYou can add a flag to sort processes by memory\\nutilized:\\ntop -o mem  81kill\\nLinux processes can receive signals  and react to\\nthem.\\nThat\\'s one way we can interact with running programs.\\nThe \\xa0kill\\xa0 program can send a variety of signals to a\\nprogram.\\nIt\\'s not just used  to terminate a program, like the name\\nwould suggest, but that\\'s its main job.\\nWe use it in this way:\\nkill <PID> \\nBy default, this sends the \\xa0TERM\\xa0 signal to the process\\nid specified.\\nWe can use flags to send other signals, including:\\nkill -HUP <PID>  \\nkill -INT <PID>  \\nkill -KILL <PID>  \\nkill -TERM <PID>  \\nkill -CONT <PID>  \\nkill -STOP <PID>  \\n\\xa0HUP\\xa0 means hang up. It\\'s sent automatically when a\\nterminal window that started a process is closed\\nbefore terminating the process.82\\xa0INT\\xa0 means interrupt , and it sends the same signal\\nused when we press \\xa0ctrl-C\\xa0 in the terminal, which\\nusually terminates the process.\\n\\xa0KILL\\xa0 is not sent to the process, but to the operating\\nsystem kernel, which immediately stops and\\nterminates the process.\\n\\xa0TERM\\xa0 means terminate . The process will receive it\\nand terminate itself. It\\'s the default signal sent by\\n\\xa0kill\\xa0.\\n\\xa0CONT\\xa0 means continue . It can be used  to resume a\\nstopped process.\\n\\xa0STOP\\xa0 is not sent to the process, but to the operating\\nsystem kernel, which immediately stops (but does not\\nterminate) the process.\\nYou might see numbers used instead, like \\xa0kill -1\\n<PID>\\xa0. In this case,\\n\\xa01\\xa0 corresponds to \\xa0HUP\\xa0. \\xa02\\xa0 corresponds to \\xa0INT\\xa0. \\xa09\\xa0\\ncorresponds to \\xa0KILL\\xa0. \\xa015\\xa0 corresponds to \\xa0TERM\\xa0.\\n\\xa018\\xa0 corresponds to \\xa0CONT\\xa0. \\xa015\\xa0 corresponds to\\n\\xa0STOP\\xa0.83killall\\nSimilar to the \\xa0kill\\xa0 command, \\xa0killall\\xa0 instead of\\nsending a signal to a specific process id will send the\\nsignal to multiple processes at once.\\nThis is the syntax:\\nkillall <name>  \\nwhere \\xa0name\\xa0 is the name of a program. For example\\nyou can have multiple instances  of the \\xa0top\\xa0 program\\nrunning, and \\xa0killall top \\xa0 will terminate them all.\\nYou can specify the signal, like with \\xa0kill\\xa0 (and check\\nthe \\xa0kill\\xa0 tutorial to read more about the specific\\nkinds of signals we can send), for example:\\nkillall -HUP top  84jobs\\nWhen we run a command in Linux / macOS, we can\\nset it to run in the background using the \\xa0&\\xa0 symbol\\nafter the command. For example we can run \\xa0top\\xa0 in\\nthe background:\\ntop & \\nThis is very handy for long-running programs.\\nWe can get back to that program using the \\xa0fg\\xa0\\ncommand. This works fine if we just have one job in\\nthe background, otherwise we need to use the job\\nnumber: \\xa0fg 1\\xa0, \\xa0fg 2\\xa0 and so on. To get the job\\nnumber , we use the \\xa0jobs\\xa0 command.\\nSay we run \\xa0top &\\xa0 and then \\xa0top -o mem &\\xa0, so we\\nhave 2 top instances running. \\xa0jobs\\xa0 will tell us this:\\nNow we can switch back to one of those using \\xa0fg\\n<jobid>\\xa0. To stop the program again we can hit \\xa0cmd-\\nZ\\xa0.\\nRunning \\xa0jobs -l\\xa0 will also print the process id of each\\njob.85bg\\nWhen a comman d is running you can suspend it using\\n\\xa0ctrl-Z\\xa0.\\nThe command will immediately stop, and you get back\\nto the shell terminal.\\nYou can resume the execution of the command in the\\nbackground, so it will keep running but it will not\\nprevent you from doing other work in the terminal.\\nIn this example I have 2 commands stopped:\\nI can run \\xa0bg 1\\xa0 to resume in the background the\\nexecution of the job #1.\\nI could have also said \\xa0bg\\xa0 without any option, as the\\ndefault is to pick the job #1 in the list.86fg\\nWhen a command is running in the background,\\nbecause you started it with \\xa0&\\xa0 at the end (example:\\n\\xa0top &\\xa0 or because you put it in the background with\\nthe \\xa0bg\\xa0 command, you can put it to the foreground\\nusing \\xa0fg\\xa0.\\nRunning\\nfg\\nwill resume to the foreground the last job that was\\nsuspended.\\nYou can also specify which job you want to resume to\\nthe foreground passing the job number , which you can\\nget using the \\xa0jobs\\xa0 command.\\nRunning \\xa0fg 2\\xa0 will resume job #2:87\\n88type\\nA command can be one of those 4 types:\\nan executable\\na shell built-in program\\na shell function\\nan alias\\nThe \\xa0type\\xa0 command can help figure out this, in case\\nwe want  to know or we\\'re just curious. It will tell you\\nhow the command will be interpreted.\\nThe output will depend on the shell used. This is Bash:\\nThis is Zsh:89\\nThis is Fish:\\n90One of the most interesting things here is that for\\naliases it will tell you what is aliasing to. You can see\\nthe \\xa0ll\\xa0 alias, in the case of Bash and Zsh, but Fish\\nprovides it by default, so it will tell you it\\'s a built-in\\nshell function.91which\\nSuppose you have a command you can execute,\\nbecause it\\'s in the shell path, but you want to know\\nwhere it is located.\\nYou can do so using \\xa0which\\xa0.

That\\nwill take care of running the \\xa0command2 \\xa0 command,\\nusing the output of \\xa0command1 \\xa0 as its argument(s).\\nLet\\'s do a simple  example. You want to remove some\\nspecific files from a directory . Those files are listed\\ninside a text file.\\nWe have 3 files: \\xa0file1\\xa0, \\xa0file2\\xa0, \\xa0file3\\xa0.\\nIn \\xa0todelete.txt \\xa0 we have a list of files we want to\\ndelete, in this example \\xa0file1\\xa0 and \\xa0file3\\xa0:\\n94We will channel the output of \\xa0cat todelete.txt \\xa0 to the\\n\\xa0rm\\xa0 command, through \\xa0xargs\\xa0.\\nIn this way:\\ncat todelete.txt | xargs rm  \\nThat\\'s the result, the files we listed are now deleted:\\nThe way it works is that \\xa0xargs\\xa0 will run \\xa0rm\\xa0 2 times,\\none for each line returned by \\xa0cat\\xa0.\\nThis is the simplest usage of \\xa0xargs\\xa0. There are\\nseveral options we can use.\\nOne of the most useful in my opinion, especially when\\nstarting to learn \\xa0xargs\\xa0, is \\xa0-p\\xa0. Using this option will\\nmake \\xa0xargs\\xa0 print a confirmation prompt with the\\naction it\\'s going to take:\\n95The \\xa0-n\\xa0 option lets you tell \\xa0xargs\\xa0 to perform one\\niteration at a time, so you can individually confirm\\nthem with \\xa0-p\\xa0. Here we tell \\xa0xargs\\xa0 to perform one\\niteration at a time with \\xa0-n1\\xa0:\\nThe \\xa0-I\\xa0 option is another widely used one. It allows\\nyou to get the output into a placeholder , and then you\\ncan do various things.\\nOne of them is to run multiple commands:\\nYou can swap the \\xa0%\\xa0 symbol I used above with\\nanything else, it\\'s a variablecommand1 | xargs -I % /bin/bash -c \\'command2 %; comm\\n96vim\\n\\xa0vim\\xa0 is a very popular file editor , especially among\\nprogrammers.

While there is a little\\nproblem with the commands I listed up to now, in\\nthis case using an emacs version from 2007 is not\\nexactly the same as using a version with 12 years\\nof impro vements and change. This is not a\\nproblem with Vim, which is up to date. To fix this,\\nrun \\xa0brew install emacs\\xa0 and running \\xa0emacs\\xa0 will\\nuse the new version from Home brew (make sure\\nyou have Homebrew  installed)\\nYou can also edit an existing file calling \\xa0emacs\\n<filename> \\xa0:\\nYou can start editing and once you are done, press\\n\\xa0ctrl-x\\xa0 followed by \\xa0ctrl-w\\xa0. You confirm the folder:103\\nand Emacs tell you the file exists, asking you if it\\nshould overwrite it:\\nAnswer \\xa0y\\xa0, and you get a confirmation of success:104\\nYou can exit Emacs pressing \\xa0ctrl-x\\xa0 followed by\\n\\xa0ctrl-c\\xa0. Or \\xa0ctrl-x\\xa0 followe d by \\xa0c\\xa0 (keep \\xa0ctrl\\xa0\\npressed).\\nThere is a lot to know about Emacs. More than I am\\nable to write in this little introduction. I encourage you\\nto open Emacs and press \\xa0ctrl-h\\xa0 \\xa0r\\xa0 to open the\\nbuilt-in manual and \\xa0ctrl-h\\xa0 \\xa0t\\xa0 to open the official\\ntutorial.105nano\\n\\xa0nano\\xa0 is a beginner friendly editor .\\nRun it using \\xa0nano <filename> \\xa0.\\nYou can directly type characters into the file without\\nworrying about modes.\\nYou can quit without editing using \\xa0ctrl-X\\xa0. If you\\nedited the file buffer, the editor will ask you for\\nconfirmation and you can save the edits, or discard\\nthem. The help at the bottom shows you the keyboard\\ncommands that let you work with the file:\\n\\xa0pico\\xa0 is more or less the same, although \\xa0nano\\xa0 is the\\nGNU version of \\xa0pico\\xa0 which at some point in history\\nwas not open source and the \\xa0nano\\xa0 clone was made\\nto satisfy the GNU operating system license\\nrequirements.106whoami\\nType \\xa0whoami\\xa0 to print the user name currently logged\\nin to the terminal session:\\nNote: this is different from the \\xa0who am i\\xa0\\ncommand, which prints more information107who\\nThe \\xa0who\\xa0 command displays the users logged in to\\nthe system.\\nUnless you\\'re using a server multiple people have\\naccess to, chances are you will be the only user\\nlogged in, multiple times:\\nWhy multiple times? Because each shell opened will\\ncount as an access.\\nYou can see the name of the terminal used, and the\\ntime/day the session was started.\\nThe \\xa0-aH\\xa0 flags will tell \\xa0who\\xa0 to display more\\ninformation, including the idle time and the process ID\\nof the terminal:108\\nThe special \\xa0who am i\\xa0 command will list the current\\nterminal session details:\\n109su\\nWhile you\\'re logged in to the terminal shell with one\\nuser, you might  have the need  to switch to another\\nuser.\\nFor exam ple you\\'re logged in as root to perform some\\nmaintenance, but then you want to switch to a user\\naccount.\\nYou can do so with the \\xa0su\\xa0 command:\\nsu <username>  \\nFor example: \\xa0su flavio \\xa0.\\nIf you\\'re logged in as a user, running \\xa0su\\xa0 without\\nanything else will prompt to enter the \\xa0root\\xa0 user\\npassword, as that\\'s the default behavior .\\n\\xa0su\\xa0 will start a new shell as another user .\\nWhen you\\'re done, typing \\xa0exit\\xa0 in the shell will close\\nthat shell, and will return back to the current user\\'s\\nshell.110sudo\\n\\xa0sudo\\xa0 is commonly used to run a command as root.\\nYou must be enabled to use \\xa0sudo\\xa0, and once you do,\\nyou can run commands as root by entering your user\\'s\\npassword ( not the root user password).\\nThe permission s are highly configurable, which is\\ngreat especially  in a multi-user  server environment,\\nand some users can be granted access to running\\nspecific commands through \\xa0sudo\\xa0.\\nFor example you can edit a system configuration file:\\nsudo nano /etc/hosts  \\nwhich would otherwise fail to save since you don\\'t\\nhave the permissions for it.\\nYou can run \\xa0sudo -i\\xa0 to start a shell as root:\\nYou can use \\xa0sudo\\xa0 to run commands as any user.\\n\\xa0root\\xa0 is the default, but use the \\xa0-u\\xa0 option to specify\\nanother user:111sudo -u flavio ls /Users/flavio  112passwd\\nUsers in Linux have a password assigned. You can\\nchange the password using the \\xa0passwd\\xa0 command.\\nThere are two situations here.\\nThe first is when  you want to change your password.\\nIn this case you type:\\npasswd \\nand an interactive prompt will ask you for the old\\npassword, then it will ask you for the new one:\\nWhen you\\'re \\xa0root\\xa0 (or have superu ser privileges) you\\ncan set the username of which you want to change the\\npassword:\\npasswd <username> <new password>  \\nIn this case you don\\'t need to enter the old one.113ping\\nThe \\xa0ping\\xa0 command pings a specific netw ork host, on\\nthe local network or on the Internet.\\nYou use it with the syntax \\xa0ping <host>\\xa0 where\\n\\xa0<host>\\xa0 could be a domain name, or an IP address.\\nHere\\'s an example pinging \\xa0google.com \\xa0:\\nThe commands sends a request to the server , and the\\nserver returns a response.\\n\\xa0ping\\xa0 keep sending the request every second, by\\ndefault, and will keep running until you stop it with\\n\\xa0ctrl-C\\xa0, unless you pass the number of times you\\nwant to try with the \\xa0-c\\xa0 option: \\xa0ping -c 2 google.com \\xa0.\\nOnce \\xa0ping\\xa0 is stopped, it will print some statistics\\nabout the results: the percentage of packages lost,\\nand statistics about the network performance.\\nAs you can see the screen prints the host IP address,\\nand the time that it took to get the response back.114Not all servers support pinging, in case the requests\\ntimes out:\\nSometimes this is done on purpose, to \"hide\" the\\nserver , or just to reduce the load. The ping packets\\ncan also be filtered by firewalls.\\n\\xa0ping\\xa0 works using the ICMP protocol  ( Internet\\nControl Message Protocol ), a network layer protocol\\njust like TCP or UDP .\\nThe request sends a packet to the server with the\\n\\xa0ECHO_REQUEST \\xa0 message, and the server returns a\\n\\xa0ECHO_REPLY \\xa0 message. I won\\'t go into details, but this\\nis the basic concept.\\nPinging a host is useful to know if the host is\\nreachable (supp osing it implements ping), and how\\ndistant it is in terms of how long it takes to get back to\\nyou. Usually the nearest the server is geographically ,\\nthe less time it will take to return back to you, for\\nsimple physical laws that cause a longer distance to\\nintroduce more delay in the cables.115traceroute\\nWhen you try to reach a host on the Internet, you go\\nthrough your home router , then you reach your ISP\\nnetwork, which in turn goes through its own upstream\\nnetwork router , and so on, until you finally reach the\\nhost.\\nHave you ever wanted to know what are the steps that\\nyour packets go through to do that?\\nThe \\xa0traceroute \\xa0 command is made for this.\\nYou invoke\\ntraceroute <host>  \\nand it will (slowl y) gather all the information while the\\npacket travels.\\nIn this example I tried reachi ng for my blog with\\n\\xa0traceroute flaviocopes.com \\xa0:\\n116Not every router travelled returns us information. In\\nthis case, \\xa0traceroute \\xa0 prints \\xa0* * *\\xa0. Otherwise, we\\ncan see the hostname, the IP address, and some\\nperformance indicator .\\nFor every router we can see 3 samples, which means\\ntraceroute tries by default 3 times to get you a good\\nindication of the time needed to reach it. This is why it\\ntakes this long to execute \\xa0traceroute \\xa0 compared to\\nsimply doing a \\xa0ping\\xa0 to that host.\\nYou can customize this number with the \\xa0-q\\xa0 option:\\ntraceroute -q 1 flaviocopes.com  \\n117clear\\nType \\xa0clear\\xa0 to clear all the previous commands that\\nwere ran in the current terminal.\\nThe screen will clear and you will just see the prompt\\nat the top:\\nNote: this command has a hand y shortcut: \\xa0ctrl-\\nL\\xa0\\nOnce you do that, you will lose access to scrolling to\\nsee the output of the previous commands entered.\\nSo you might want to use \\xa0clear -x\\xa0 instead, which\\nstill clears the screen, but lets you go back to see the\\nprevious work by scrolling up.118history\\nEvery time we run a command, that\\'s memorized in\\nthe history .\\nYou can display all the history using:\\nhistory\\nThis shows the history with numbers:\\nYou can use the syntax \\xa0!<command number>\\xa0 to repeat\\na command stored in the history , in the above\\nexample typing \\xa0!121\\xa0 will repeat the \\xa0ls -al | wc -l\\xa0\\ncommand.\\nTypically the last 500 commands are stored in the\\nhistory .\\nYou can combine this with \\xa0grep\\xa0 to find a command\\nyou ran:\\nhistory | grep docker  119\\nTo clear the history , run \\xa0history -c \\xa0120export\\nThe \\xa0export\\xa0 command is used to export variables to\\nchild processes.\\nWhat does this mean?\\nSuppose you have a variable TEST defined in this\\nway:\\nTEST=\"test\"\\nYou can print its value using \\xa0echo $TEST \\xa0:\\nBut if you try defining a Bash script in a file \\xa0script.sh \\xa0\\nwith the above command:\\n121Then you set \\xa0chmod u+x script.sh \\xa0 and you execute\\nthis script with \\xa0./script.sh \\xa0, the \\xa0echo $TEST\\xa0 line will\\nprint nothing!\\nThis is because in Bash the \\xa0TEST\\xa0 variable was\\ndefined local to the shell. When executing a shell\\nscript or another command, a subshell is launched to\\nexecute it, which does not contain the current shell\\nlocal variables.\\nTo make the variable available there we need to define\\n\\xa0TEST\\xa0 not in this way:\\nTEST=\"test\"\\nbut in this way:\\nexport TEST=\"test\"\\nTry that, and running \\xa0./script.sh \\xa0 now should print\\n\"test\":\\nSometimes you need to append something to a\\nvariable. It\\'s often done with the \\xa0PATH\\xa0 variable. You\\nuse this syntax:\\nexport PATH=$PATH:/new/path  122It\\'s common to use \\xa0export\\xa0 when you create new\\nvariables in this way, but also when you create\\nvariables in the \\xa0.bash_profile \\xa0 or \\xa0.bashrc\\xa0\\nconfiguration files with Bash, or in \\xa0.zshenv\\xa0 with Zsh.\\nTo remove a variable, use the \\xa0-n\\xa0 option:\\nexport -n TEST  \\nCalling \\xa0export\\xa0 without  any option will list all the\\nexported variables.123crontab\\nCron jobs are jobs that are scheduled to run at specific\\nintervals. You might have a command perform\\nsomething every hour, or every day, or every 2 weeks.\\nOr on weekend s. They are very powerful, especially\\non servers to perform maintenance and automations.\\nThe \\xa0crontab\\xa0 command is the entry point to work with\\ncron jobs.\\nThe first thing you can do is to explore which cron jobs\\nare defined by you:\\ncrontab -l\\nYou might have none, like me:\\nRun\\ncrontab -e\\nto edit the cron jobs, and add new ones.124By defau lt this opens with the default editor , which is\\nusually \\xa0vim\\xa0. I like \\xa0nano\\xa0 more, you can use this line\\nto use a dif ferent editor:\\nEDITOR=nano crontab -e\\nNow you can add one line for each cron job.\\nThe syntax to define cron jobs is kind of scary . This is\\nwhy I usually use a website to help me generate it\\nwithout errors: https://crontab-generator .org/\\nYou pick a time interval for the cron job, and you type\\nthe command to execute.125I chose to run a script located in\\n\\xa0/Users/flavio/test.sh \\xa0 every 12 hours. This is the\\ncrontab line I need to run:\\nI run \\xa0crontab -e \\xa0:\\nEDITOR=nano crontab -e\\nand I add that line, then I press \\xa0ctrl-X\\xa0 and press \\xa0y\\xa0\\nto save.\\nIf all goes well, the cron job is set up:\\nOnce this is done, you can see the list of active cron\\njobs by running:\\ncrontab -l\\n* */12 * * * /Users/flavio/test.sh >/dev/null 2>&1  \\n126You can remove  a cron job running \\xa0crontab -e \\xa0 again,\\nremoving the line and exiting the editor:\\n127uname\\nCalling \\xa0uname\\xa0 without any options will return the\\nOperating System codename:\\nThe \\xa0m\\xa0 option shows the hardware name (\\xa0x86_64\\xa0 in\\nthis example) and the \\xa0p\\xa0 option prints the processor\\narchitecture name ( \\xa0i386\\xa0 in this example):\\nThe \\xa0s\\xa0 option prints the Operating System name. \\xa0r\\xa0\\nprints the release, \\xa0v\\xa0 prints the version:128\\nThe \\xa0n\\xa0 option prints the node network name:\\nThe \\xa0a\\xa0 option prints all the information available:\\n129On macOS you can also use the \\xa0sw_vers\\xa0 command\\nto print more information about the macOS Operating\\nSystem. Note that this differs from the Darwin (the\\nKernel) version, which above is \\xa019.6.0\\xa0.\\nDarwin is the name of the kernel of macOS. The\\nkernel is the \"core\" of the Operating System, while\\nthe Operating System as a whole is called\\nmacOS. In Linux, Linux is the kernel, GNU/Linux\\nwould be the Operating System name, although\\nwe all refer to it as \"Linux\"\\n130env\\nThe \\xa0env\\xa0 comma nd can be used to pass environment\\nvariables witho ut setting them on the outer\\nenvironment (the current shell).\\nSuppose you want to run a Node.js app and set the\\n\\xa0USER\\xa0 variable to it.\\nYou can run\\nenv USER=flavio node app.js  \\nand the \\xa0USER\\xa0 environment variable will be accessible\\nfrom the Node.js app via the Node \\xa0process.env \\xa0\\ninterface.\\nYou can also run the command clearing all the\\nenvironment variables already set, using the \\xa0-i\\xa0\\noption:\\nenv -i node app.js  \\nIn this case you will get an error  saying \\xa0env: node: No\\nsuch file or directory \\xa0 because the \\xa0node\\xa0 command\\nis not reachable , as the \\xa0PATH\\xa0 variable used by the\\nshell to look up commands in the common paths is\\nunset.\\nSo you need to pass the full path to the \\xa0node\\xa0\\nprogram:\\nenv -i /usr/ local/bin/node app.js  131Try with a simple \\xa0app.js\\xa0 file with this content:\\nconsole.log(process.env.NAME)  \\nconsole.log(process.env.PATH)  \\nYou will see the output being\\nundefined  \\nundefined  \\nYou can pass an env variable:\\nenv -i NAME=flavio node app.js  \\nand the output will be\\nflavio \\nundefined  \\nRemoving the \\xa0-i\\xa0 option will make \\xa0PATH\\xa0 available\\nagain inside the program:\\nThe \\xa0env\\xa0 command can also be used to print out all\\nthe environment variables, if ran with no options:\\nenv 132it will return a list of the environment variables set, for\\nexample:\\nYou can also make a variable inaccessible inside the\\nprogram you run, using the \\xa0-u\\xa0 option, for example\\nthis code removes the \\xa0HOME\\xa0 variable from the\\ncommand environment:\\nenv -u HOME node app.js  HOME=/Users/flavio  \\nLOGNAME=flavio  \\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/L\\nPWD=/Users/flavio  \\nSHELL=/usr/local/bin/fish  \\n133printenv\\nA quick guide to the \\xa0printenv \\xa0 command, used to\\nprint the values of environment variables\\nIn any shell there are a good number of environment\\nvariables, set either by the system, or by your own\\nshell scripts and configuration.\\nYou can print them all to the terminal using the\\n\\xa0printenv \\xa0 command. The output will be something\\nlike this:\\nwith a few more lines, usually .\\nYou can append a variable name as a parameter , to\\nonly show that variable value:\\nprintenv PATH  \\nHOME=/Users/flavio  \\nLOGNAME=flavio  \\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/L\\nPWD=/Users/flavio  \\nSHELL=/usr/local/bin/fish  \\n134Conclusion\\nThanks a lot for reading this book.\\nI hope it will inspire you to know more about Linux and\\nits capabilities.\\nTo learn more, check out my blog flaviocopes.com .\\nSend any feedback, errata or opinions at\\nhey@flaviocopes.com'"
